<p> <i> i think self discovery is the greatest achievement in life because once you discover your self and accept who you are then you can fufil your true potential and be happy. And an adage says" for a man to achieve all that his demanded of him he must regard himself a greater than he is.<br> My achievement started when i was in Primary school, when i was little and running on a race track at school, I always run as fast as i could because it was my dream in life to steadily raised my level of aspiration and expectation because i belived no one ever achieve greatness in life without dreams. i makes my dream become reality by earned a lot of respect, victory and prides from an academicians on my performance on road track, i also impressed my parent, colleagues and my close aquitances on race track competition which was on of great achievement in my life. <br> Morever, After i completed my primary and secondary school, i was given pride on my performance on my west african examination council (WAEC) and i was also given senior secondary school certificate SSCE Which impressed me to did JAMB in the following year and later got admission to KWARA STATE UNIVERSITY to studied Library and Information science which saves as one of my great achievement in life.<br> <br>
